## Graphics
 
Ascension To The Throne ValkyrieSKIDROW uses the same graphics engine as Ascension to the Throne, which is based on the Aurora Engine used by Neverwinter Nights.

## Sound
 
Ascension To The Throne ValkyrieSKIDROW has a good sound design that enhances the mood and immersion of the game. The game has a fitting soundtrack that consists of epic orchestral music that matches the tone and pace of the game. The game also has some voice acting that adds personality and emotion to the characters. However, some of the voice acting is poorly done or out of sync with the subtitles.
 
The game also has some sound effects that add realism and feedback to the game. The game has different sounds for weapons, spells, units, enemies, and environments. However, some of the sound effects are repetitive or too loud or too quiet.
  
## Verdict
 
Ascension To The Throne ValkyrieSKIDROW is an enjoyable addon for fans of Ascension to the Throne or strategy RPG games in general. The addon offers a new story with a strong female protagonist, new units and enemies to fight with or against, new

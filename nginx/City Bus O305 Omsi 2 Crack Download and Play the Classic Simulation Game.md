But what if you want to experience the history of German omnibuses on your home computer and drive a classic city bus from the 1970s and 1980s? Well, you are in luck, because there is an add-on for OMSI 2 that lets you do just that: Citybus O305.
 
Citybus O305 is an add-on that features four different models of the Mercedes-Benz O305 bus, a standard bus that was widely used in Germany and other European countries. You can choose between an automatic gearbox or a manual gearbox bus, and drive them on two different routes: line 92 in Spandau, Berlin, or one of the five bus lines in Neundorf, a fictional mid-sized town in the center of Germany.

So, how do you drive a classic German bus in OMSI 2? Well, it depends on which model you choose. If you opt for the automatic gearbox bus, you can simply use the arrow keys or the controller to accelerate, brake, and steer. You can also use the mouse to look around and interact with the buttons and switches on the dashboard.

If you want a more challenging and realistic experience, you can try the manual gearbox bus. In this case, you will need to use the Q and A keys to shift gears up and down, and the spacebar to clutch. You will also need to pay attention to the engine speed and the traffic lights, as well as the passengers' requests and complaints. You can use the F1 key to see a list of keyboard commands and controls.
 
Whichever bus you choose, you will have to follow the timetable and the route map. You can see them on the screen by pressing the F3 key. You can also use the F5 key to see a list of possible destinations and stops. You will have to announce them to the passengers using the N key or a microphone.
